# Facial-emotion-detection

Real-Time Face and Emotion Recognition, leveraging Deep Learning and OpenCV for enhanced accuracy! 🎉 This endeavor combined cutting-edge machine learning techniques with real-time applications to create a system that recognizes faces and identifies emotions simultaneously.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Datasets:
Custom face dataset (400 images/person) and an emotion dataset (7 classes with 35,000 images).
Training/testing split: 80%/20%.

Technologies Used:
Facial Recognition: CNN with feature extraction via convolutional layers, achieving 92% accuracy.
Emotion Detection: CNN focused on subtle patterns, reaching 85% accuracy.

Real-Time Applications:
Smart Classrooms: Monitor student engagement.
Retail Analytics: Understand customer moods.
Healthcare: Track emotional well-being.

Challenges & Insights:
Managed variability in lighting and angles during real-time detection.
Data augmentation and adaptive learning rates boosted model performance.

🎯 Future Directions:
Expand datasets to include diverse demographics.
Integrate multi-modal inputs like speech or gestures for richer analysis.
This project was an incredible learning experience, and I look forward to applying these insights to future innovations! 🚀
